# Deprecated Files

This folder contains files and directories that are no longer used in the active codebase but are kept for reference or in case they need to be restored.

## Contents:

### Backup Files:
- `babel.config.js.bak` - Backup of babel configuration
- `postcss.config.cjs.backup` - Backup of PostCSS configuration

### Test/Debug Directories:
- `supabase-connection-test/` - Empty directory for Supabase connection testing
- `supabase-debug/` - Empty directory for Supabase debugging
- `supabase-test/` - Empty directory for Supabase testing
- `sentry-example-page/` - Example Sentry error page (likely for testing)

### Legacy Routes:
The codebase previously used `/my-dashboard/` routes which have been replaced with `/dashboard/` routes for consistency.

## Usage:
- Files in this directory should not be referenced in the active codebase
- If you need to restore any deprecated functionality, move the relevant files back to their original locations
- This directory can be safely deleted if you're sure none of the deprecated functionality is needed
